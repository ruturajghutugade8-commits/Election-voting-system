# Election-voting-system 🗳️

A simple **frontend-only mini project** for an online voting system built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project simulates how users can vote for candidates, view live counts (on the client side), and see results.  
👉 In the future, a backend (Node.js / Express / MongoDB, etc.) can be added to store votes securely.

---

## Features
- Candidate list displayed with details (name, photo, party, etc.)
- Simple UI for voting (buttons or forms)
- Client-side vote counting (no backend yet)
- Instant result display (winner / vote counts)
- Responsive design (works on desktop and mobile)

---

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Styling
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Logic & interactivity

---

## Future Enhancements
- ✅ Connect to a backend (Node.js/Express + MongoDB) for secure vote storage  
- ✅ Add authentication (voter login/ID check)  
- ✅ Admin dashboard for managing candidates  
- ✅ Prevent multiple voting from same user
